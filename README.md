# CH32V00X Standby External Interrupt Wakeup

The [example files](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH32V003EVT_ZIP.html) for CH32V00X (tested on CH32V003) include samples for standby with auto wakeup and sleep with external wakeup but not standby with external wakeup.
This is just a little sample that shows current usage of about 9uA while in standby and wakeup through pulling D0 low.
